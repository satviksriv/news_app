#### Overview

This is an app that displays top headlines in your region.
Users also have the option to filter the news according to a certain category given in the app.
I have used the API provided by https://newsapi.org/ to collect the news and display it in the app.
Users can also view the full news in the app itself.
I have implemented this app through Flutter and Dart.
